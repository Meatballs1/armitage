Metasploit's RPC daemon shut down. There are a
few possibilities for this.

1. You do not have enough RAM. Without enough
   RAM, Metasploit's RPC daemon will start and
   silently close. 

   Solution: Increase your RAM

2. You do not have the msgpack Ruby gem required
   by Armitage. This is a new requirement. 
   Armitage now requires a Metasploit 4.0 or 
   greater base install. msfupdate does not help.

   BackTrack 5 users--this affects you! 
   BackTrack 5r1 is OK though.

   Solution: Install Metasploit 4.1+ using the 
   full setup installer.
