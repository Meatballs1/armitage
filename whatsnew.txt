Armitage Changelog
==================

21 Jan 11 Changes
--------- 
- Increased wait time between connection attempts to MSF RPC
- Fixed bug with Windows command shell not working when using Armitage from a
  Windows host. 
- Host refresh using sysinfo now only happens when no OS is set for the host.
- Fixed a deadlock condition caused when an automatic sysinfo request was 
  made while a Meterpreter tab for the same host was open.

18 Jan 11 Changes
---------
- Added a Migrate Now! item to Meterpreter Access menu. Runs migrate -f.
- Right-click in Meterpreter console now shows menu as before (silly bugs).
- Armitage now detects hashdump failure and reports possible causes to you.
- Armitage now binds default handler to 0.0.0.0. 
- Added a table view for the targets area. Go to View -> Targets to change the
  setting. If you're working with many hosts, table view may be better for you.
- Added preliminary support for Metasploit post/ modules. You can launch them 
  and if a host is highlighted, Armitage will populate the SESSION var for you.
- Armitage now uses the sysinfo command in a meterpreter session to pull host
  OS info if it doesn't know it. This also means Armitage will auto-populate
  the host OS when a client-side attack is successful.
- Tab completion is now ignored when input field is empty

13 Jan 11 Changes
---------
- Hosts reported as Windows Me now display W2K era Windows logo.
- "Hail Mary" attack is now launched and managed by Armitage. Exploits are 
  selected using the output of db_autopwn AND the operating system information
  Armitage knows. Also attacks are launched in a more optimal order (sorted by 
  exploit rank/age). This is a big improvement over db_autopwn by itself. 
- Added a link to the Armitage Issue Tracker in the Help menu.
- Updated remote exploit payload selection to choose Java payloads or Windows 
  shell payloads before resorting to the generic/* payloads.
- Updated client-side exploit launcher to let you select the target. Armitage 
  uses this target (plus the exploit name) to determine which payload to use.
  multi/java_signed_applet works very nicely now ;)
- Fixed (once and for all now) the mysterious OS info not refreshing bug.
  Now those pretty OS pictures will show up if Metasploit knows about the OS.
- Added a 52 character length limit to a target's description in the target
  dropdown. This stops weird GUI layouts caused by long target descriptions.
- Exploit recommendations now take into account FreeBSD hosts.
- Added an OpenBSD option to the hosts menu.
- Armitage now does a setg AutoLoadStdapi true when setting up MSF.
- Last modified field of file browser now sorts properly.
- Jobs console and its kill feature should now work in all circumstances.
- Session menus for meterpreter now limited for non-Win meterp sessions.
- Updated Armitage/Windows to provide a better startup experience. Simply
  extract the archive over your MSF install and rock n' roll.

22 Dec 10 Changes
---------
- Updated meterpreter shell and command shell console to honor your set
  preferences. I forgot to pass $preferences to the console constructor. Doh!
- Added a -d/--debug command line option. This will dump System.getProperties()
  and a log of all exchanges with the MSF server to debug.log in the current
  working directory.
- To play nice with existing conventions, Armitage is now licensed under the
  BSD license. Distribute, use, reuse, recycle.... have fun.
- Fixed a deadlock condition that arose when a large nmap scan is imported
- About dialog now shows up centered.
- Armitage now has a graphic for Cisco IOS. You can mark a host as a Cisco IOS 
  device. Also Armitage recognizes IOS from an NMAP Scan.	
- Fixed Armitage "crash" due to read timeouts. This would occur for those of
  you who ran a really taxing operation (e.g., db_autopwn).
- Added a time limit flag to db_autopwn (20s)
- Ctrl+R is now even more aggressive clearing internal data structures.
- Shell N -> Meterpreter... no longer blocks waiting for the operation to
  complete.

13 Dec 10 Changes
---------

- Added Meterpreter -> Browse -> Webcam Shot to grab webcam snap shots.
- You may now click the image in the webcam/screenshot view to save it.
- Workspace -> Create menu now automatically switches you to the net workspace.
- UNIX shell sessions now have an Upload... menu. This item will open a local
  file and use the printf command on the remote host to put it together. It's 
  slow but it works. 
- Removed the rename file menu item from the file browser. It turns out I had 
  my Windows command shell vs. meterpreter command interface crossed. The 
  command doesn't exist in Meterpreter.
- Upload button now waits until file is uploaded to refresh file listing
- Added Timestomp item to File Browser popup menu. This works like a clipboard.
  Select Get MACE to capture the MACE values of the current file. Use Set MACE
  on another file to set the MACE values to the currently known attributes.
- Dump hashes menu item no longer pulls up a new credentials tab. 
- Added a Refresh button to the credentials tab.
- Updated db refresh code to be a little smarter about when it needs to merge
  db_notes hints into the MSF database.

6 Dec 10 Changes
--------

- added -y filename.yml command line option for specifying a YAML file with
  database parameters
- updated "Start MSF" to launch "ruby msfrpcd" on Windows. This requires the 
  current working directory of Armitage be set to the Metasploit base directory.
- jobs view now parses job output with only 3 columns of information.
- connect dialog is now centered on your screen when you start Armitage
- Armitage now saves your settings when you use Start MSF.
- Armitage now forces cells in editor mode to save before launching a module or
  an exploit. This should prevent a few surprises where things seemed like they
  weren't working for a few of you.
- MSF Discovery Scans are now started from a separate thread, preventing 
  Armitage from "locking up" while the scans launch. A dialog also comes up to
  state how many scans were launched.
- MSF Discovery Scans are now limited to 2 threads/scan on Windows and 8 on
  other operating systems. This prevents serious lag issues caused by 
  starting too many threads.
- connect dialog is now a window, meaning it has an icon in whatever your 
  window manager is and if you close it Armitage exits.
- updated DB Connect String helper dialog to ask for DB user, DB pass, DB host, 
  and DB name. This should prevent some of you from confusing the database 
  user/pass with the MSFRPCD user/pass.
- Current environment variables are now passed to msfrpcd when executed from
  Armitage. This will allow msfrpcd to inherit any PATH changes and other 
  necessary things when Armitage is run from a shell script or batch file.
- Added .svn folders to the Armitage distribution. Now you can use svn update .
  to keep your install of Armitage up to date.
- File browser upload and make directory commands now allow files with spaces
  in them.
- Armitage will now exit if it takes longer than 5 seconds to shutdown msfrpcd
  when cancel is pressed during the connecting phase.

25 Nov 10
---------
- start msf button now kills msfrpcd session if db_connect fails
- set default database options to mysql with BackTrack 4 R2 settings.
- Armitage -> Exit menu now kills msfrpcd, if the "Start MSF" button was used
- Added ability to set up a multi/handler from Payload launch dialog

13 Nov 10
---------
- fixed file browser directory icon showing up in every field within Windows L&F
- added an export button to the credentials view. This will save the credentials to 
  a pwdump format file.
- fixed console highlighting issue, sadly you'll need to click in the console input 
  box for it to have focus again. Write once, debug everywhere.
- added "hail mary" attack option--this launches db_autopwn
- attack menus now honor the armitage.required_exploit_rank.string setting
- added Ctrl+R shortcut for refreshing the target view (esp. OS info)
- fixed db_notes parsing for latest version of MSF (3.5.x?)
- fixed how auxiliary scans are displayed in the jobs table.
- db connect helper now prepopulates fields with info taken from connect string
- added an 8s timeout to abort the database connect if it fails.
- OS from db_notes to db_hosts refresh is now guaranteed on connect
- Packaged everything into a single jar file, now I can code in what I like 
  without hassle from people who are too lazy to look at the code.
- SSL handshake now fails after 8 seconds (should give those of you trying
  an SSL connect to a non-SSL server an idea that something is up)
- added an executable to launch Armitage on Windows
- fixed command shell interaction bug caused by directories with spaces.
- Start MSF button now reports an error if it couldn't start MSF-RPC

2 Nov 10
--------
- Initial (priv8) release.
