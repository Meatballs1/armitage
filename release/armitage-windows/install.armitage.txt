This text file documents how to install Armitage on Windows.

(1) Download and Install the Metasploit Framework from http://www.metasploit.com/

(2) Go to Start -> All Programs -> Metasploit Framework -> Metasploit Update

    Don't skip this step or you will have headaches later. If Metasploit tells you 
    any Armitage files conflict, then delete the files and repeat this step.

(3) Go to Start -> All Programs -> Metasploit Framework -> MSF Console. This will
    launch the Metasploit console and ready the database for use with Metasploit.

(4) Unzip this archive into the Metasploit directory 
    (e.g., c:\program files\rapid7\framework\)

(5) Create a shortcut (on your desktop maybe?) to armitage.bat and set the icon
    to icons\armitage.ico

(*) That's it. Now you can double-click your shortcut, Start MSF, and Armitage
    should just work.

In the future, all of these steps will be handled by the Metasploit installer.

If you want to use Armitage as a stand-alone client, navigate to: msf3/data/armitage 
and double-click armitage.exe. This will launch Armitage without the pre-populated
database settings.
